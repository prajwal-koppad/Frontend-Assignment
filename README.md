Getting Started with Create React App:

This is a software for managing the user in a syatem where we can add details of new user, edit the details of the existing user, delete any user details. Here I've used session storage to manage the data, every time we close browser tab it will restore all the original values that are hardcoded.  

To run the project,
in the project directory, you can run: `npm start` which

* Runs the app in the development mode.
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
